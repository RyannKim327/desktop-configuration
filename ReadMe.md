### Grub Bootloader
> You may just copy the folder `my-boot` into this directory `/boot/grub/themes/`. Then configure the `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` and look for the `set theme=` in my editor it is in line 94. And paste the exact path of the theme.txt of your configured grub bootloader.
If you're afraid, then try to use this [repository](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/Top-5-Bootloader-Themes) and configure the install.sh and add your theme.

---
### Bashrc
> The file `.bashrc` inside of my file is just my own configuration, you may copy it if you want to. Also you may change some different stuffs by using alias.

---
### Fastfetch
> I'm currently using fastfetch instead of neofetch, since it is a pre-installed in my device, then I used it and reconfigure. Just look for some file inside.

---
### Hyde
> This would be the folder where you may found my theme in my device. You may also configure your own.

---
### Hypr
> This folder configures my hyprland which is a modified version of hyprdots and recustomized some keybindings.

---
### Waybar
> This folder, it is just my configuration of status bar, nothing special with it.

---
### Wallpaper and extra assets
> I use figma to design my logo, and canva to create animations and stuffs, I hope it helps.

---
### NOTE
> Make sure you're aware in what you're doing, I don't have any responsibility if ever that it fails on yout device thou it worked on mine. Just do at your own risk.
